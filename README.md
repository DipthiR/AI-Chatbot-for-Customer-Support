# AI Chatbot for Customer Support
This is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide customer support using DialoGPT (a variant of GPT-2). It can engage in general conversation and be further customized to handle specific customer support tasks such as providing information, answering FAQs, and assisting with common issues.

## Features
AI-Powered Conversations: Uses the pre-trained DialoGPT model to understand user input and generate human-like responses.

Customizable: Easy to extend with a custom dataset to handle specific customer queries.

Command-line Interface (CLI): Interact with the bot via the terminal.

Web Interface (optional): Can be extended with Streamlit to provide a web interface for easier interaction.

## Requirements
Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Transformers library for natural language processing

Torch for model loading and inference

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install transformers torch
For a web-based version with Streamlit, also install:

pip install streamlit
## Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository (or create a new Python script):

If you're starting from a repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot
Download the Pre-trained Model:

The DialoGPT model will be automatically loaded when running the code (no need for manual download).

## Usage
1. CLI-based Chatbot
Run the Python script directly from the command line:

python chatbot.py
It will prompt you to enter text, and the bot will respond. Type exit to end the conversation.

Example Interaction:

Customer Support Chatbot. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.
You: How can I track my order?
Bot: You can track your order by visiting our order tracking page on our website.
You: exit
Goodbye! Have a great day!
2. To launch the web interface, run the following command:

streamlit run app.py
This will start a Streamlit app on your local machine, and you can interact with the chatbot through the web browser.
## How It Works
Model Loading: The script loads the pre-trained DialoGPT-medium model from the Hugging Face library.

User Input Processing: The chatbot listens to user input, tokenizes it, and appends an End-of-Sequence (EOS) token.

Response Generation: The chatbot generates a response using the DialoGPT model.

Output: The generated response is displayed to the user.

## Customizing the Chatbot
Custom Dataset for Customer Support:

To make the chatbot specific to your customer support needs, you can fine-tune the DialoGPT model on your own dataset.

Create a dataset with customer support-related questions and answers.

Implement Fallback Mechanism: If the chatbot doesnâ€™t understand a query, you can add fallback responses like: "I'm unable to assist with that. Please contact customer support."

Expand Functionality: Implement additional features such as:

Order tracking

Product information

Account management

Escalating issues to human agents
